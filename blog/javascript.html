    <h1>JavaScript vs. Ruby, Round 1</h1>
    <h2>A brief comparison of Ruby Classes and JavaScript Constructor Functions</h2>
    <h4>Sunday, March 6, 2016</h4>

    <section>
      <p>Welcome back. Today we'll be shifting gears yet again and discussing some fundamental differences between Ruby Classes (which I introduced in the post before this) and a very new concept to me:  JavaScript Constructor functions.  This will be just as much a learning opportunity for you as it will be for me.</p>

      <p>So we already know that Ruby classes basically act as blueprints for creating new objects of the given class.  JavaScript constructor functions work roughly the same way.  Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that perform specific tasks much akin to methods in Ruby.  To begin, let's look at how you create a constructor function:  </p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          function newObject() {
            // code here
          };
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Pretty easy so far.  Now when we start adding properties to this new function we will begin to see where constructors differ from regular JavaScript functions.</p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          function newObject(argument) {
            this.property1 = argument
            this.property2 = "property 2"
            this.property3 = function() {
              // code block here
            };
          };
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>As you can see, we now have three properties inside our function:  a variable defined with whatever argument you input, a string, and yes, even a function within our function!  Now, you're probably wondering what is up with "this".  Here is where we will see similarities between (and differences from) Ruby classes.</p>

      <p>"This" is self-referential.  It refers to the properties inside this specific instance of this function.  Very similar to instance variables and methods within Ruby classes.  Here is another similarity for you:  when you want to create a new instance of a function, you must instantiate it thusly:</p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var newNewObject = new newObject();
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Look familiar?</p>

      <p>All of this is somewhat relatable territory between the two languages.  However, this is where things also start to differ.  In Ruby, when you create a new instance of a class, all of it's methods and variables are the same for each other instance you create for the same class (unless you alter the class itself.)  Altering the class would cause all instances to change as well.  This is not the case in JavaScript and is one of the reasons why constructor functions are so useful.  You can use constructor functions when you need multiple instance of the same object.  If you instantiate a new version of the function, you can change that individual instance's properties <i>without</i> affecting the properties of any instances of the same function.  Pretty darn cool, eh?</p>

      <p>As always, feel free to reach out with any comments, questions, or concerns.  If you want to read up more on constructor functions, I would recommend <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-basics-of-object-oriented-javascript--net-7670">this</a> excellent article or use the MDN JavaScript docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Constructor">here</a> as a starting point.  Until next time, happy coding!</p>
