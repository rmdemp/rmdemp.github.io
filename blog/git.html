    <h1>Version Control:  What is it?</h1>
    <h2>A short intro to version control with Git and GitHub</h2>

        Being a relative newcomer to the concept of version control can be rather intimidating.  A good bit of initial setup, plenty of new commands and concepts to know and use, and multiple working versions of projects.  It's a lot to take in.  However, once you get past the not-so-steep learning curve things start to make more sense.  But before we get into that, a question:  why version control in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Version control helps you keep track of what's going on in your project and is even more helpful when working on teams with multiple people.  Any number of people can be working on any number of versions of the same project simultaneously without stepping on anyone else's toes.  All of these versions can then be peer reviewed and the improvements can then be implemented to the main project.  It allows for multiple revisions which can all be documented and commented upon for future review.  Most importantly, it allows you to revert back to a previous version if something happens to the current working version (i.e. bugs in your code, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many tools out there to help you implement version control for your projects.  One of the most popular is Git, which is open source.  Git operates from your commmand line, which is where any good web developer does most of their work (right, guys?)  Git allows you to create and work on multiple branches where you can create and alter new work and test it before applying  it back to the master branch.  This prevents you from making potentially dangerous errors which could be a detriment to your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Git is ran locally on your computer, it also interfaces with GitHub.  GitHub is a website which allows for remote storage of projects so that anyone anywhere can gain access to your projects for collaboration.  This is part of the beauty of version control and coding in general, I feel.  Collaboration allows your work to be seen by others, creating new ideas and allowing your work to be reviewed/edited by someone else who may pick up on something you had not previously seen in your work.  I think that this fostering of community with GitHub is a very powerful part of the workflow.  And with that being said, get out there and collaborate and have a great time doing it!
