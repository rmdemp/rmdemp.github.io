    <h1>Gettin' Classy!</h1>
    <h2>A basic overview of Classes in Ruby</h2>
    <h4>Monday, February 27, 2016</h4>

    <section>
      <p>So today we're going to be talking about Classes in Ruby (as it says in the title.)  What is a class, you ask?  A class is an object (remember, everything in Ruby is an object) that allows you to create new instances of itself with all of it's method defitions built in.  As we get into the code examples, I think that what this means will become more clear.  For starters, let's create a new class.  We do this like so:  </p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          def NewClass
            # (Your code goes here)
          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Pretty easy, huh.  It's just like creating a new method definition except that class names must ALWAYS start with a capital letter so that Ruby can differentiate them from methods or other objects.  So our next step is to start adding some code to our new class.

      <p>To help you better understand the following concepts, lets create a class that mimics a real-world object.  Let's build a new class to represent a bicycle.  The "Bike" class will be our blueprint which we'll use to make more "Bike" objects.  We'll also be putting some instance methods (meaning that these methods are only useable by this particular class) in here too so our new "Bike" objects don't just sit there doing nothing.  </p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          def Bike

            def accelerate
              # go fast!
            end

            def decelerate
              # slow down!
            end

            def change_gears
              # change gears up or down
            end

          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Alright, so it's a start.  As you can see, we've now defined three different methods within our "Bike" class.  Now each time we create a new "Bike" object by doing this...  </p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          new_bike = Bike.new
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>...our new "Bike" object, called "new_bike" will now have all of those methods prebuilt into them.</p>

      <p>Let's back up a little for a second.  We've created this new bike but we need to make sure that when we call it's methods upon it that everything is working properly on the inside.  We need to makes sure that our new bike is initialized with all the proper variables and methods.  Let's a new method called "initialize":</p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          def Bike

            def initialize(speed_up, slow_down, shift)
              @go_fast = speed_up
              @slow_down = slow_down
              @change_gears = shift
            end

            def accelerate
              @go_fast
            end

            def decelerate
              @slow_down
            end

            def change_gears(up, down)
              @change_gears
            end

          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Hold on!  What's going on here?  What's up with all the "@" signs and variable definitions?</p>

      <p>Well, what we've done is added the ability for a new Bike object to be initialized with all of the properties defined in the class.  We have it initialized to take in three arguments (speed_up, slow_down, or shift) and these correspond to the methods below them.  Accelrate, decelerate, and change_gears all define these methods.</p>

      <p>Now, the "@" sign designates our new variables as "instance variables."  Instance variables are like local variables except whereas local variables can only be used within a single method our instance variables here can now be called upon and used by any method within the Bike class.  Pretty nifty, huh?  Our instance variables here point to the incoming arguments so that the new instances of the Bike class can route them to the appropriate methods.  Instance variables  will definitely come in handy when you start building your own classes with many different variables and will help keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!)</p>

      <p>Now, we can create a new "Bike" object and start using methods and passing them arguments:  </p>

      <div>
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          new_bike = Bike.new  # creates a new "Bike" object called "new_bike"

          new_bike.accelerate  # tells new_bike to speed up

          new_bike.change_gears(up)  # tells new_bike to change gears up

          new_bike.decelerate  # tells new_bike to slow down

          new_bike.change_gears(down)  # tells new_bike to change gears down
        </code>
      </pre>
      </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Obviously, this is a very simple way of looking at classes.  You would need to write all of the appropriate code to tell the bike to speed up/slow down, change gears, etc., but I hope this gives you a good feel for how classes are created and used in Ruby.  You can easily imagine them as small factories that contain the blueprints for the production of more instances of themselves.  If you desire a much more technical explanation, I'd direct you to the Ruby docs for Classes which can be found <a href src="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Class.html">here</a>.  As always, if you'd like to talk more about Classes (or anything else Ruby) or have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.  In the mean time, happy coding!</p>
