#### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I think the main thing that I learned is that a little of any of them can go a long way.  I would apply borders to all HTML elements from time to time in order to see the layout of boxes, margins, and padding.  This allowed me to better use these spaces to format elements and place where I wanted to.  Sometimes I would get unexpected results just from changing the padding/margin amounts of different elements.  Sometimes a small increment in either value could result in an element moving in a major way on the page.

#### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that CSS positioning is nowhere near as easy as it may seem!  While definitely frustrating at first, I feel that after the first hour (ha ha) or so of positioning elements it became a little bit easier to understand how they all flow together.  I made great usage of the "float", "padding", and "margin" attributes in order to lay things out on the page.

#### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest aspects definitely had to do with text formatting (size, weight, font, borders, etc.), background colors, all of the really simple design elements.  I think the most difficult ones for me to implement were the navigation bars and trying to set up all the proper padding/margins for the respective enclosing and enclosed elements (div's down to ul's down to li's) and then lining them up relative to other elements on the page.

#### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned how to use the "iframe" tag in order to link to my blog entries in an element on the same page.  As far as formatting, again, I learned more about the relationships between enclosing and enclosed elements and how to position them in regards to their parents/children/etc.
