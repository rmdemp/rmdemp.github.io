    <div class="about-text">
    <p>I am originally from beautiful rural northwest Georgia, but have resided in Chicago for the past eight years, with five years in Atlanta before that.  My main passions are music, language, literature, and travel and any combination thereof.  I have made electronic music on my own and with others for the past 16 years and I love and seek out all things sound-related.  I am an absolute, self-professed "synth nerd."  I have studied Spanish for over 10 years, both on my own and academically, and I consider myself an above-average speaker but I am always looking to improve.  That being said, I'd ultimately like to wind up living in a Spanish-speaking country at some point so that I can attain total fluency (this has been a lifelong goal.)  As far as quirks, I guess you could call me an obsessive tea drinker.  My favorites would probably be Lapsang Souchang (tastes like campfire) and Gunpowder Green (don't you dare pour boiling water on that!) </p>
