- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I really enjoyed working with a pair on this part of the site building process.  It was nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of and to have an extra pair of eyes to help with site aesthetics.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Absolutely.  I've never wireframed in this manner before.  I usually just go from a brief drawing straight into laying down the outline in code.  However, for this we used the Mockingbird web app to generate our wireframe.  It definitely looked a lot nicer than most of my drawings and was nice to be able to move around different elements and create a realistic-looking mockup.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We both felt that simplicity was key.  Start very small and keep it clean and simple.  As recommended, we only used simple semantic elements to begin with.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

For this exercise, there were no new elements that I learned of, however we did toy around a little bit with alignment attributes.  However, we left those out as they didn't give the desired outcome and we knew that those kinds of things would be dealt with later when we delve into CSS.
